# Background
Street View Imagery (SVI) has been at the forefront of numerous remarkable advancements in spatial data science. Yet, it begs the question: Have we exhausted all SVI possibilities or are there uncharted territories waiting to be discovered? In this session, we aim to bridge the gap between experienced researchers and newcomers to SVI.

# Content
The outline of the session is as following:

Unleashing creativity in identifying novel research topics
Advancing methodological approaches for SVI
Overcoming limitations and exploring complementary techniques
Navigating potential barriers and fostering a supportive environment for new researchers
Linking SVI approaches to socio-economic perceptions of the city

# Speakers
- Mohamed R. Ibrahim: Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Spatial Data Science, University of Leeds
- Yuhao Kang: Assistant Professor at the University of South Carolina
- Pengyuan Liu: Assistant Professor at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology

We look forward to your participation and fruitful discussions. Let us redefine the boundaries of SVI and unearth the possibilities together.
