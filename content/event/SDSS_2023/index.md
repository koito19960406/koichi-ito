# Session Format:
A Series of Presentations

# Session Description:
Join us in an engaging exploration of the untapped potential in Street View Imagery (SVI)
within the realm of spatial data science. As we continue to witness remarkable
advancements, there lingers the question: Have we exhausted all SVI possibilities or are
there uncharted territories waiting to be discovered? With the emergence of breakthrough
technologies such as large language models, generative AI methods, and graph-based
learning, we believe there is an abundant opportunity to leverage SVI across multiple
urban domains.

In this thought-provoking session, we bridge the gap between experienced researchers
and newcomers to SVI by showcasing an array of innovative work and encouraging
stimulating discussions around prevailing challenges and future research possibilities.
The presentations will cover:

- Unleashing creativity in identifying novel research topics
- Advancing methodological approaches for SVI
- Overcoming limitations and exploring complementary techniques
- Navigating potential barriers and fostering a supportive environment for new researchers
- Linking SVI approaches to socio-economic perceptions of the city

# Session Hosts
- Koichi Ito: Urban Analytics Lab at the National University of Singapore
(koichi.ito@u.nus.edu)
- Winston Yap: Urban Analytics Lab at the National University of Singapore
(winstonyym@u.nus.edu)

# Guest Speakers
- Mohamed R. Ibrahim: Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Spatial Data
Science, University of Leeds
- Yuhao Kang: Assistant Professor at the University of South Carolina
- Pengyuan Liu: Assistant Professor at Nanjing University of Information Science and
Technology

# Target Audience
Our session is designed to engage a broad spectrum of attendees. From seasoned SVI
researchers and novices to city planners and urban practitioners who utilize SVI surveybased methods to gain urban context insights. By featuring our esteemed guest
speakers, each a torchbearer in SVI expertise and experience, we aspire to kindle
interest, promote innovation, and foster a collaborative environment for all participants.
Join us in this quest to redefine the boundaries of SVI and unearth the possibilities
together.
